* Email: mren@cs.toronto.edu

## Usage
```
    python question_generator.py \
            -parser_path {Stanford parser path} \
            -sentence {Single sentence} \
            -list {List of sentences, line dilimited file} \
            -parsed_file {Parsed file generated by stanford parser} \
            -output {Output file}
```

## Prerequisites
1. You need to download NLTK WordNet package.
```
python
import nltk
nltk.download()
d
wordnet
```

2. You need to download Stanford Parser
at http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download
Extract the zip into a folder and remember the path

3. You need to copy lexparser_sentence.sh into the Stanford Parser folder.
```
cp lexparser_sentence.sh stanford-parser/lexparser_sentence.sh
```

## Examples
1. Run single sentence.
```
python question_generator.py -sentence "A man is riding a horse"
```

2. Run a list of sentences.
Provide a file with each line in the file to be a sentence.
Output is a pickle file, storing a list. Each element in the list is a
tuple of five fields:
- Original sentence ID (0-based)
- Original sentence
- Generated question
- Answer to the generated question
- Type of the generated question

```
python question_generator.py -list sentences.txt -output questions.pkl
```

3. Run a pre-parsed file.
Run stanford parser to pre-compute the parse trees.

```
lexparser.sh sentences.txt > sentences_parsed.txt
```

```
python question_generator.py -list sentences.txt \
                             -parsed_file sentences_parsed.txt \
                             -output questions.pkl
```
